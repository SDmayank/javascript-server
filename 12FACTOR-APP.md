# The Twelve-Factor App
## Introduction
In the modern era, software is commonly delivered as a service: called web apps, or software as a service. By the use of twelve factor app methodlogy we can build the software as a service apps that:

2.Clean contract with the underlying operating system offering maximum portability between execution enviroments
3.Are suitable for deployment on modern cloud platforms, obviating the need for servers and systems administration.

## The Twelve Factors are:
**1.Codebase**
**2.Dependencies**
**3.Config**
**4.Backing services**
**5.Build, release, run**
**6.Process**
**7.Port Binding**
**8.Concurrency**
**9.Disposability**
**10.Dev/prod Parity**
**11. Logs**
**12.Admin Process**
